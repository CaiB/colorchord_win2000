#######################################

# Colorchord now automatically picks most of the important audio driver settings automatically
# and will default to PULSE with ALSA as a fallback on Linux, 
# On Windows it will default to WASAPI with winmm (WIN) as a fallback 
# To force a specific driver use the "sound_source" property, the following values are valid
# sound_source:
# Linux: PULSE, ALSA
# Windows: WASAPI, WIN 
# Android: ANDROID 
sound_source = WIN

# The "devplay" property sets the playback device for CNFA (what speakers to go to) most uses for
# colorchord don't use audio output so this can be almost universally ignored
# devplay =

# The "devrecord" Sets the device to get audio from. This will default to monitoring your speaker 
# output. For WASAPI, "default" searches for a mic, and "defaultRender" searches for your loopback.
# For PulseAudio @DEFAULT_SOURCE@ selects the default input (typically a microphone) and
# @DEFAULT_MONITOR@ selects the default loopback device.
